        Daily Life, based on street photography and everyday life in Bosnia. Bosnia Daily Life is a project that
        records everyday life in a public place. The very publicness of the setting enables the photographer to
        take candid pictures of strangers, often without their knowledge. Street photographers do not
        necessarily have a social purpose in mind, but they prefer to isolate and capture moments which might
        otherwise go unnoticed.",
